- Hello, Im Sam Peacock I have enjoyed learning about computers and technology my whole life which is what lead me to pursuing Computer Science as a major. I have Co-Oped at three different companies throughout my time here at UC. First being Bosch in Charleston, South Carolina. I completed my first two terms here and really enjoyed my time growing my skills in Python, data visualization software's such as Tableau, and learning new skills such as Staubli Robotics Suite. After Bosch, I decided to try something new and completed one Co-Op at the Cincinnati Reds, creating scoreboard programs and managing the stadium's systems through games. I completed my last Co-Ops as a software developer at Fives in Hebron Kentucky. I worked on the software of robots that roll carbon fiber onto airplane parts; which mostly consisted of C and C++ development. I have learned great technical and non technical skills from my experience and I am excited to transfer those skills into this capstone project.
