# Project Description

### Team Name: Peacocks
### Team Members: Sam Peacock (Computer Science), peacocsl@mail.uc.edu

### Project topic:
- I am planning on making a personal portfolio website; this will be a big learning experience for me, as I have not done much work with web development-based languages.
I plan on including all my work experience, projects, classwork, and much more as the project becomes more developed. I think it will be a very good project for resumes and interviews as it's a good talking point for my skills.
